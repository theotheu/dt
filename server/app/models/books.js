     *   - modificationDate is a date
     *   - a title of the book is unique
     *   - title and author are required
     *   - the default value for date is now
     *
     * - Question: What are the differences between a 'Schema Type' and a JSON object? Use the references to motivate your answer.
     * - Question: What is the function of the 'collection' property?
     * - Question: Suppose you have a model for 'Person'. What would be the default collection name?

     *
     * In Mongoose you can define custom validators.
     * If the value does not fit the the definition, an error is returned.

     * - Instruction: Add a validator for title. A title must have a length of at least 8 characters.
     * - Question: There are four locations of validations, each for a specific type of validation. Give for each validation an example and describe why that location is the best location for that specific type of validation.
     *   1. Database (technical constraints, primary key)
     *   1. Schema (simple business rules)
     *   1. Application (complex business rules)
     *   1. Client-side (form validation)
     * @class Validator/Book/title
     * @returns true or false. In case of ```false```, a message 'Invalid title' is returned as well.
     * @see http://mongoosejs.com/docs/validation.html
